  # By default, for a number of zones a small default 'nothing here'

  # You may also have to use domain-insecure: zone to make DNSSEC work,

# Create entries like below, to make all queries for 'example.com' and
# 'example.org' go to the given list of nameservers. list zero or more
# nameservers by hostname or by ipaddress. If you set stub-prime to yes,
# the list is treated as priming hints (default is no).
# With stub-first yes, it attempts without the stub if it fails.
# Consider adding domain-insecure: name and local-zone: name nodefault
# to the server: section if the stub is a locally served zone.

# Forward zones
# Create entries like below, to make all queries for 'example.com' and
# 'example.org' go to the given list of servers. These servers have to handle
# recursion to other nameservers. List zero or more nameservers by hostname
# or by ipaddress. Use an entry with name "." to forward all queries.

# Views
# Create named views. Name must be unique. Map views to requests using
# the access-control-view option. Views can contain zero or more local-zone
# and local-data options. Options from matching views will override global
# options. Global options will be used if no matching view is found.
# With view-first yes, it will try to answer using the global local-zone and
# local-data elements if there is no view specific match.

#   name: "viewname"
